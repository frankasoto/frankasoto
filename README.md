### Hey! I'm Frank. ðŸ‘‹
As a dedicated educator, I've had the privilege of nurturing young minds and fostering a passion for learning. My journey as a teacher has instilled in me a deep appreciation for problem-solving, a skill I carry into all aspects of my life. This unique blend of teaching and problem-solving fuels my drive to create meaningful, user-centric web applications that can make a positive impact on the world.
